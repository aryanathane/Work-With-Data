# Work-With-Data
Project Overview
StockScraper is a data-driven project designed for financial analysis using Python, web scraping, and data visualization. In this project, we extract historical stock prices and quarterly revenue reports for popular stocks such as Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop using Yahoo Finance (yfinance) and web scraping techniques. The collected data is then visualized in an interactive dashboard to analyze market trends and key performance indicators (KPIs).

Tech Stack & Libraries Used
Python – Core programming language
yfinance – Fetching historical stock data
BeautifulSoup – Web scraping financial data
Pandas – Data manipulation and analysis
Plotly – Interactive data visualization
Jupyter Notebook – For easy experimentation and reporting
